# AWS-Scean-Detection-Using-Python-and-Git-Bash
This is the code find the place from the image
This script uses AWS Rekognition to analyze an image stored in an S3 bucket and deduce the scene based on the labels found. The approach is separated into two main steps: label detection and scene inference. Label Detection: The detect_labels method interacts with AWS Rekognition using the boto3 library to detect labels in the supplied image. The detected labels (objects, sceneries, or concepts) are then shown on the image as bounding boxes with labels indicating the confidence score for each detected entity. Scene Inference: The analyze_image function uses the observed labels to determine the scene of the image. It searches for certain terms such as 'Banana,' 'Pineapple,' 'Lime,' or 'Apple' to infer the picture as a 'Marketplace.'. 'Bus Station,' 'Bus Stop,'
